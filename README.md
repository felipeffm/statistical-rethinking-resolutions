## What is this?
* This repo is a collection of notebooks that carry numpyro solutions for the exercises in the book Statistical Rethinking Second Edition. 
* These solutions can help someone following the book and the examples coded in numpyro (link). 
* There are other repositories with solutions (), but most are coded in R language. 

## Structure
* The solutions of each chapter block of exercises are in each specific notebook named with the chapter number and name.
* Every notebook starts informally explaining the numpyro code used in solutions and then the solutions.
 
## Disclaimer
I do not guarantee that all resolutions are correct, as they were based on the knowledge acquired from reading the book and R public solutions. So please, if you found something wrong or poorly defined open a issue.
