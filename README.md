## What is this?
* This repo carries a collection of notebooks with numpyro solutions of the exercises in [Statistical Rethinking Second Edition](https://github.com/rmcelreath/stat_rethinking_2022). 
* These solutions can help someone following the [book and the examples coded in numpyro](https://github.com/fehiepsi/rethinking-numpyro). 
* There are other repositories with solutions such as [wjakethompson](https://sr2-solutions.wjakethompson.com/linear-models-causal-inference.html), [xcelab](xcelab.net/rmpubs/rethinking/rethinking_solutions_2.pdf) or [erikkusch](https://www.erikkusch.com/courses/rethinking/chapter-02/), but all are coded in R language. 

## Structure
* The notebooks named `<chapter_number>_resulution` have the respective chapter exercises solutions. 

* The notebooks named `<chapter_number>_numpyro` informally explain the new numpyro methods and functions used at the resolutions of the chapter.
 
## Disclaimer
I do not guarantee that all resolutions are correct, as they were based on the knowledge acquired from reading the book and R public solutions. So please open an issue if you find something wrong or poorly defined.
